<!-- Create a README.md file and for each algorithm include the following:

* Explain to a five year old how the algorithm works (3-4 sentences max)
*Psuedo code for each sorting implementation
*In your own words, describe the performance of the alogirthm for the following cases:
    * Best case scenario
    * Worst case scenario -->

# Sorting Algorithms

## Bubble Sort

### What is it?
Bubble sort sorts numbers by pairing up numbers starting from the beginning of the list. If one number is smaller than the other, the smaller number gets ordered first. You compare each pair of numbers from start of the list to the end, and keep comparing and swapping numbers until all numbers are in order.

### Pseudocode
> Create a loop that runs from 0 until the length of the array
> Compare a number in the array to the number next to it in the array
> If the first number is larger, then swap the position of the 2 numbers
> Continue to run this loop until the entire array is sorted

### Performance
**Best Case Scenario**
Performance will be best if the array is already sorted, or if only the first two numbers in the list were out of order.

**Worst Case Scenario**
Performance will be the least ideal if the numbers are in reverse order.

## Insertion Sort

## Selection Sort

## Merge Sort
